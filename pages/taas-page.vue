            <h2 class="sub-header mt-6 mb-4">Problems to solve</h2>
            <p>These are the problems facing the Imo State Internal Revenue Service. The effort of Anamen Nigeria limited to design a solution is to eliminate these problems which are not only digital thus, creating digital solution to digital and non-digital problems.</p>
            <br> <br>
            <p>
                
                <b>1. Inefficient Manual Processes:</b>
                The tax administration system in Imo State relies heavily on manual processes for tax collection, filing, and auditing. This leads to delays, human errors, and difficulties in managing records, making the process cumbersome for both tax authorities and taxpayers.
                <br><br>
                <b>2. Low Taxpayer Compliance:</b> 
                Many taxpayers in Imo State are either unaware of their tax obligations or find the filing process too complex and time-consuming. This results in widespread tax evasion, incomplete filings, and reduced government revenue.
                <br><br>
                <b>3. Inaccurate Revenue Tracking:</b>
                With the absence of a centralized system, it is difficult for the government to accurately track tax payments, leading to revenue leakages. Many transactions go unrecorded or are poorly documented, resulting in discrepancies and potential fraud.
                <br><br>
                <b>4. Poor Accessibility and Communication:</b>
                Taxpayers often face challenges accessing tax-related information and services, especially in rural areas where digital infrastructure is lacking. The lack of user-friendly digital platforms further discourages compliance.
                <br><br>
                <b>5. Corruption and Lack of Transparency:</b>
                The manual handling of tax-related activities opens up opportunities for corruption and underreporting. This undermines public trust in the system, as there is a lack of transparency in how taxes are collected, allocated, and spent.
                <br><br>
                <b>6. Inadequate Taxpayer Identification:</b>
                Inaccurate or incomplete records of taxpayers, especially due to lack of biometric identification, make it difficult to verify individuals and enforce tax laws. This leads to duplicate registrations and revenue losses.
                <br><br>
                <b>7. Limited Reporting and Auditing Capabilities:</b>
                Traditional methods offer limited capabilities in terms of reporting, auditing, and compliance monitoring. Without automated solutions, authorities struggle to generate real-time reports, which hampers decision-making and policy adjustments.
                <br><br>
                <b>8. Difficulty in Filing and Paying Taxes:</b>
                Taxpayers face hurdles when it comes to filing taxes and making payments, often needing to physically visit tax offices. This not only causes delays but also discourages compliance due to inconvenience.

            <h2 class="sub-header mt-6 mb-4">Solutions</h2>
            <p>The Tax Automation and Administration Solution System (TAAS) is designed to address these critical issues by automating and digitizing tax-related functions</p>

                <br> <br>
                <b>4. Tax Officer portal: </b>Facilitation of a transparent and improved Tax Officer portal for the hierarchical approval and rejection of tax application. This eliminate the problem of ghost or fake tax officers.
                <br> <br>
                <b>5. Established Tax payer History Portal: </b>This solution system provides the tax officers the current and past tax details and history of tax payers, inclusive of tax payer income change.
                <br> <br>
                <b>6. Revenue Code Generator: </b>A Revenue Code Generator assigns unique identifiers to every tax-related transaction. This allows for clear tracking of payments, making it easier to manage and audit tax payments. Taxpayers receive a revenue code upon completing their transactions, which they can use to verify payment or resolve disputes. It ensures that each transaction is recorded accurately and transparently in the tax authority's system.
                <br> <br>
                <b>7. Assessment Management Portal: </b>The Assessment Management Portal allows tax administrators to evaluate and manage tax liabilities for individuals and businesses. Through this portal, tax authorities can calculate taxes based on income, assets, or business activities, ensuring accurate assessments. It also includes the management of tax exemptions, penalties, and payment deadlines, streamlining the assessment process and reducing errors associated with manual calculations.
                <br> <br>
                <b>8. centralized Admin Portal: </b>The Admin Portal serves as the control center for tax authorities, offering a centralized dashboard where administrators can manage the entire tax system. Administrators can use this portal to oversee and ensure the proper functioning of the various components of TAAS. i.e. User management (registering and managing taxpayers), Monitoring tax collections and compliance, Generating reports, and System configurations.
                <br> <br>
                <b>9. Central Billing System (CBS): </b>The Central Billing System (CBS) consolidates all tax liabilities (personal income tax, property tax, corporate tax, etc.) into a single billing interface for the taxpayer. This system simplifies the taxpayer experience by providing a clear overview of all taxes due, pending, or paid. It reduces administrative complexity and ensures that taxpayers receive accurate and up-to-date bills for all their tax obligations.
                <br> <br>
                <b>10. Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) system: </b>The Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) system is an automated tax withholding method that allows employers to deduct income tax from employees' salaries and remit it directly to the government. In TAAS, the PAYE system ensures accurate tax calculations and deductions, providing a transparent and streamlined process for both employers and employees. This automation reduces manual errors and increases the efficiency of income tax collection.
                <br> <br>
                <b>11. Capital Portal: </b>The Capital Portal is designed to handle capital taxes, such as taxes on capital gains, property, and investments. It offers specialized tools for taxpayers to report capital income and for tax authorities to assess these earnings and liabilities. The portal ensures that capital-related taxes are processed efficiently and transparently. It also supports the management of asset declarations and investment-related tax obligations, providing a tailored solution for more complex tax scenarios.
                <br> <br>
                <p>Together, these components form a comprehensive TAAS solution that automates tax administration, improves accuracy, enhances compliance, and streamlines the tax experience for both taxpayers and authorities.</p>
