            <h2 class="sub-header mt-6 mb-4">Problems to solve</h2>
            <p>
                Maxcoach's existing website was built using React, but the platform had become increasingly difficult to maintain and scale efficiently. Performance issues arose, particularly as new features were added, resulting in slower loading times and a less responsive user experience. The complexity of managing state, reusable components, and animations in React led to development bottlenecks, slowing down feature releases and creating technical debt.
            </p>

            <h2 class="sub-header mt-6 mb-4">Solution</h2>
            <p>The decision to migrate from React to Vue.js was based on the need for a more maintainable, flexible, and efficient framework. Vue.js offered a simpler learning curve, better documentation, and a more organized structure with its single-file components.
                <br><br>
               One of the key improvements was the extensive use of reusable components throughout the application. This modular approach allowed the team to break down the UI into smaller, maintainable parts that could be easily reused across different pages and features. By creating reusable components for elements like navigation bars, buttons, and form inputs, we not only reduced redundancy but also sped up development, making future updates much more efficient.
               <br><br>
               Additionally, Vueâ€™s ecosystem of libraries, such as Vue Router for dynamic routing and Vuetify for UI design, streamlined the process of implementing consistent styling. For animations, I used Vue-Transition-Group and other Vue animation libraries to integrate seamless, performant transitions that elevated the user experience without compromising speed. These tools enabled smoother interactions and visually appealing effects while optimizing load times and responsiveness.
               <br><br>
               Overall, the shift to Vue.js resulted in a more scalable and maintainable website, offering faster performance, better user experience, and simpler ongoing development.
